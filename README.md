##MLS Fan Page Project

this is a simple react app to show react router navigation profeciency as well as component based rendering.

##Usage

You can navigate using the bar at the top to go to the teams page where the league has been created for you.
You can also go to myTeam to create a team of your own to add to the list.
At any time you can remove a single team by clicking the remove button on every team card.

##Setup

You will need to use json-server to watch the db file using the command 
```
json-server --watch db.json
```
This is assuming you have json server installed

You will then need to run the app using the command 
```
npm start
```
You Should now have a working version of the app on your machine (Note: you must complete these steps in this order as the json server likes to only use the first port spot that the app would take up if launched first)
